Balanced Binary Trees (AVL Trees)
---------------------------------
BST Opperations depends on the height of the tree.
Keeping it balanced gives O(LogN) Garanteed
Heights of 2 child sub trees differes by 1 at max
Same as Red-Black trees

AVL vs Red-Black:
- AVL Slower to construct thank Red-Black
- AVL Quicker to Search than Red-Back

Almost exactly the same as BST, only insert we have to check if balanced
