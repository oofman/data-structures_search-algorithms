Balanced Binary Trees (AVL Trees)
---------------------------------
BST Opperations depends on the height of the tree.
Keeping it balanced gives O(LogN) Garanteed
Heights of 2 child sub trees differes by 1 at max
Same as Red-Black trees

AVL vs Red-Black:
- AVL Slower to construct thank Red-Black
- AVL Quicker to Search than Red-Back
(for lookup intensive trees use AVL trees)

Logic: (Almost exactly the same as BST)
- on every insert we have to check if balanced, and do rotation
- Leave nodes children must have height is -1 (nil)
