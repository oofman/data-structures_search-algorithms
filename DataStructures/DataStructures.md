# Data Stuctures

- Arrays
- Linked List
- Heap (technically abstract data type array)

## Abstract Data Stuctures

Define the model (logical description) for a data structure

- Stack (arrays / linked Lists)
- Queue (arrays / linked Lists)
- Priority Queues (heaps / self balancing trees)
- Dictionary / Hashmap / Associative arrays (Hashtables / BST)
- Binary Search Trees
- Ternary Search Trees - 3 children only (tries as many children)

### Algorythms normally have a trade-off between

```bash
Running time complexity - Less running time, more memory
Memory time complexity - Less memory, longer running time
```

```bash
FYI: Dijkstra Algorithm
-----------------------
O(N*2) -> Without correct data structure
O(NLogN) -> With correct data structure
```

## Heap VS Stack Memory

Stack Memory:

- Stack memory most important for stack data-type
- Call-Stack Abstract Data Type, all active subroutines / methods / function on program
- Keeps track of point to which each active subrouting should return control
- Limited Size
- Fast Access
- Local Variables
- Space is mamaged by CPU in RAM
- Vars can not be resized

Heap Memory:

- Heap mem uses double-linked-list
- Large Region of mem not auto managed (mem leak)
- no size limits
- Slow Access
- reference types & objects
- mem may be fragmented
