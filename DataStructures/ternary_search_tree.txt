Ternary Search Trees - 3 children only (tries as many children)
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Supports search and sort (efficiently)
- Tries use lots of memory
- TST
  - Less references
  - Less null values
  - Store chars or strings in node
- Each node
  - Less (left child)
  - equal (middle)
  - greater (right child)
- balancing TST not worth the effort
- used instead of hashmaps
- hashing examine entire string TST not
- TST better than hashing
  - Seach misses
  - More flexable than BST (no hashing collisions)
