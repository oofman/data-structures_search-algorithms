Given a binary tree, print out it's elements from top to bottom in zig-zag order, starting from left to right.

For example, given the tree:
                2
              /   \
            8       5
          /  \        \
        4      9       24
             /       /    \
           11       3      7
                             \
                              12

The result should be : 2, 5, 8, 4, 9, 24, 7, 3, 11, 12
